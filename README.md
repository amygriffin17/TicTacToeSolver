# TicTacToeSolver
This repo contains my solution to the tic-tac-toe / connect 4 solver written in Javascript. It takes in a representation of a 4x4 board and checks if the game has been won.

## Running tests
I placed the unit tests in `TicTacToe.test.js`. Those tests can be run by installing jest and then running with `npm test`.
